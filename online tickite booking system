Explanation:

The "Ticket" entity represents a ticket booked by a user for a specific event and seat.
It includes information such as ticket ID, event ID, user ID, seat ID, purchase date, and status.
The "Event" entity represents an event for which tickets can be booked. It includes details such as event ID, event name, event date, and event location.
The "User" entity represents a user of the online ticket booking system. It includes user ID, username, password, email, name, and address.
The "Seat" entity represents a seat available for booking in an event. It includes seat ID, seat number, event ID, and availability status.
The relationships between the entities are as follows:

Each ticket is associated with one event, and each event can have multiple tickets (one-to-many relationship: Event to Ticket).
Each ticket is associated with one user, and each user can have multiple tickets (one-to-many relationship: User to Ticket).
Each seat is associated with one event, and each event can have multiple seats (one-to-many relationship: Event to Seat).
Please note that this is a basic representation, and in a real-world scenario, 
there might be additional entities and relationships based on the specific requirements of the online ticket booking system.
